# Connecting to the PsGallery Repository via a Corporate Proxy
When running Get-PsRepository behind a corporate proxy you may get the error below  

WARNING: Unable to find module repositories.

To resolve this open PowerShell in elevated mode and run the following:
```
notepad $PROFILE
```
This will start notepad and open your PowerShell profile. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, Notepad will prompt you to create it.

Add these lines to the profile script:
```
[system.net.webrequest]::defaultwebproxy = new-object system.net.webproxy('http://ProxyHostName:ProxyPortNumber')
[system.net.webrequest]::defaultwebproxy.credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials
[system.net.webrequest]::defaultwebproxy.BypassProxyOnLocal = $true
```
Save, close and restart PowerShell.

# User Administration via PowerShell

```
### Gets users from Azure Active Directory
```
Get-MsolUser
```
### Displays all of the properties for the user from Azure Active Directory and displays in a list format

```
### Disable specific service plans when assigning a user a license
The New-MsolLicenseOptions cmdlet creates a License Options object. This cmdlet disables specific service plans when assigning a user a license using the Set-MsolUserLicense cmdlet.

The following example creates a LicenseOptions object that disables most services in the licensing plan named reseller-account:ENTERPRISEPACK (Office 365 Enterprise E3) except Office 365 ProPlus, Office for the web, Exchange Online and SharePoint Online.
```
$LO = New-MsolLicenseOptions -AccountSkuId "reseller-account:ENTERPRISEPACK" -DisabledPlans KAIZALA_O365_P3, WHITEBOARD_PLAN2, MIP_S_CLP1, MYANALYTICS_P2, BPOS_S_TODO_2, FORMS_PLAN_E3, STREAM_O365_E3, Deskless, FLOW_O365_P2, POWERAPPS_O365_P2, TEAMS1, PROJECTWORKMANAGEMENT, SWAY, INTUNE_O365, YAMMER_ENTERPRISE, RMS_S_ENTERPRISE, MCOSTANDARD
```

The following example creates a new account for Joe Bloggs that assigns the license and disables the services described in the previous section and sets their location to United Kingdom
```
New-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName JoeBloggs@domainname.co.uk -DisplayName "Joe Bloggs" -FirstName Joe -LastName Bloggs -LicenseAssignment reseller-account:ENTERPRISEPACK -LicenseOptions $LO -UsageLocation GB
