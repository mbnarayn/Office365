# Connecting to the PsGallery Repository via a Corporate Proxy
When running Get-PsRepository behind a corporate proxy you may get the error below  

WARNING: Unable to find module repositories.

To resolve this open PowerShell in elevated mode and run the following:
```
notepad $PROFILE
```
This will start notepad and open your PowerShell profile. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, Notepad will prompt you to create it.

Add these lines to the profile script:
```
[system.net.webrequest]::defaultwebproxy = new-object system.net.webproxy('http://ProxyHostName:ProxyPortNumber')
[system.net.webrequest]::defaultwebproxy.credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials
[system.net.webrequest]::defaultwebproxy.BypassProxyOnLocal = $true
```
Save, close and restart PowerShell.
